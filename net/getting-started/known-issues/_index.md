description: Read about the known issue of C# Publisher PUB Conversion and Manipulation API.

## **Known Issues**
Aspose.PUB for .NET provides the capability to read and convert PUB files to PDF in your .NET applications. However, the API lacks the support for converting images in a PUB file to PDF and such images won't become part of output PDF. The feature is already in our plans for implementation and will soon become part of the API with our future releases.
