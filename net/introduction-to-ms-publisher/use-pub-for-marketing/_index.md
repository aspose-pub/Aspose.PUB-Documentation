MS Publisher is mostly used by small businesses, organizations, and individuals who want to create marketing materials or other publications without the need for advanced design skills to reduce marketing costs.

Understanding your target audience is about identifying and analyzing the characteristics, preferences, needs, and behaviors of the people or cohorts of people who are most likely to use/already use your product. It is a crucial step when starting a business because there is no point in creating goods that do not cover someone's needs. The stronger the need, the more you understand those who are in this need the more chances for success you have.
Understanding your audience is really important when creating publishing materials because it helps you create relevant and valuable to them content. There are some examples to explain to you how:
 - **Text size.** - You will need to use bigger letters in your marketing production if your audience consists mostly of older people who probably have worse eyesight. You will also use bigger texts when your target group is small children.
- **Text design.** - Fancy, bright-colored letters will attract children when business people will be pleased with calm, classic color schemes and fonts.
- **Graphic content.** - You study your audience to understand if you can put images and which ones, graphics, diagrams, and schemes you need to know. For example, if you know that your target group is students, you may add the markup of the ruler to your carton ads, so they will keep them for a longer time and more students will have a chance to see it.
- **Additional content.** - You may add other content, not linked to your business on the back of your materials, so people would gladly take, keep and spread it. For example, if your business is placed in a mountain resort, then you may add the scheme of ski tracks or a map of the attractions.

- Have a visual hierarchy using size, color, and placement to guide the viewer's eye through the design.
- Follow basic design principles such as balance, alignment, and repetition.

## Writing Compelling Marketing Texts ## 
One of the key parts of any publication is text. To be effective in grabbing the attention of potential customers and driving sales they have to be written according to the so-called rules:


- **Learn your audience.** - It's important to have a portrait of your customers and their motivation. Consider their demographics, interests, and needs to adjust your marketing message.
- **Use persuasive language.** - Add special phrases to highlight the importance of the immediate purchase and motivate action, such as "only 2 items left in stock", "act now," and "exclusive deal." But do not overdo this, as users may note if you always have "only 2 items left in stock" and either think nobody is actually interested in your items or that you are lying to them.
- **Highlight benefits.** - Yes you may focus on the features your product has, but it is considered to be more effective to "boast" about benefits your goods have in comparison to the competitors or to the previous version. Do not forget to explain how it will improve the customer's life or solve their problems.
- **Use clear and concise language.** Avoid complicated lexicons or industry jargon to make your message easy to understand. Yes, you can use some inside jokes or a game of words, but be careful with it and sure that you pinpointed your target audience correctly.
- **Use storytelling.** - Use personal stories or experiences to show how your product or service has helped others. You may also tell how customer feedback helped you to fix or spot drawbacks of your goods. This will make you look more reliable and trustworthy and make your message more memorable.
- **Use visuals.** - Images, plots, tables, anything to make your materials more appealing. Just keep in mind that some people just are not good at remembering text information, so there always has to be something else in addition.
- **Provide your audience with social proof.** -  Add real customer reviews, feedback, or statistics to demonstrate the effectiveness of your product or service.
- **Call to action.** - Clearly state what you want customers to do. You can ask them to make a purchase, subscribe, or lead more customers to get a better discount.
- **Test and optimize.** - Experiment with different marketing texts. Provide AB, and AAB testing, polls, and surveys to analyze their effectiveness to make better-optimized messages.
- **Add ways to provide feedback and communicate.** - write how to find you in social media, mail, and phone number, so the customer can communicate and clarify the information in a way that is comfortable to them. Apart from texts, you may also add a barcode that leads directly to a landing page or a listing.
- **Avoid hate speeches, offensive language, and discrimination.** - The simple discriminative phrase may ruin your reputation in just a moment. Keep updated about the vocabulary that can be used, and take some time to research the topics you write the texts for controversial "dangerous" topics, like religion, or politics. 

These are just common tips that help you create compelling marketing texts that engage your target audience and improve sales.
