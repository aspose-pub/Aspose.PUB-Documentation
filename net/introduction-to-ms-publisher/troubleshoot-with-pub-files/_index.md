Every software therefore every file format has its pros and cons. This article is about to help you find solutions to most issues you may get working with MS Publisher. Among them are: comparability issues, missing fonts or images, printing problems, and corrupted files. Let's dig in!

## Missing Fonts or Images ## 
This common issue occurs when sharing `.pub` files between devices that don't have the same fonts or images installed.

### What to do if fonts are missing in a .pub file? ###

- **Install the missing fonts.** - For this, you first need to find out which font is missing and then install it on your device.
- **Substitute the missing fonts.**- In case you cannot install the missing fonts, - try substituting them with similar fonts that are available on your computer. This will require taking the following steps:
1. When you open a `.pub` file you will receive a notification that some fonts are missing.
2. Click on the "Options" button in the notification window.
3. Here you will get the "Font Substitution" dialog box with a list of missing fonts and the options for fallback. Examine the list of suggested substitutes and select the one you are satisfied with.
4. Click on the "Substitute" button.
5. Repeat the procedure for all the rest missing fonts(if they are there).
6. Save the file.
- **Embed the missing fonts.** - The option that is correct if only you are the creator of the file, if not, - you may ask the creator to do it for you so anyone who opens the file will be able to see the correct fonts. For this follow the order.
1. Open the needed file.
2. Click on the "File" tab and select "Options".
3. There click on "Save" in the left-hand menu.
4. Check the box next to "Embed fonts in the file".
5. Here you can choose either "Embed only the characters used in the publication" or "Embed all characters". The first option will let you decrease the file size.
6. Click "OK"  and close the dialog box. Then save the file.
- [**Convert the pub file**](https://products.aspose.app/pub/conversion/pub).-  If none of the above options work, you can try converting the pub file to a different, more popular, and supported file format, such as PDF. [**PUB to PDF Conversion**](https://docs.aspose.com/pub/net/pub-to-pdf/) will ensure that the fonts are embedded within the file and will be available to anyone who works with it. 

### What to do if images are missing in a .pub file? ###

- **Check the place where the images are.** - If the images are not in the folder where they are supposed to be, MS Publisher is not able to find and use them. You need to locate and place them in the original folder. 

- **Check if the images are embedded**. The software allows you to embed images in the file itself, rather than linking to an external file. To find out if the missing images are embedded in the `.pub` file you need:
1. Select the image in Publisher, right-click on it, and choose "Format Picture". 
2. In the appearing dialog box, click on the "Picture" tab.
3 Check if the "Link to File" option is selected. If not, - the image is embedded in the file.

- **Check if the images were deleted**. - You could accidentally delete them so it would be helpful to check your Recycle Bin. If they are there, just restore them.
- **Check if the images are corrupted**. - For this, try opening the images in a different program to see if they are still accessible or damaged. If they are ok, you can try to reinsert them into the file.
- **Recreate or replace the missing files**. - This step is helpful if nothing else helps.


## Formatting Errors of .pub files ## 

Formatting errors are ones like when text boxes or images are not aligned correctly, or when page margins are not proper. Here are a few suggestions to fix such issues:
- **Check the formatting**. Inspect the document to find the formatting errors there.
- **Use the "Repair" function**. - To do this follow the order:
1. Go to the "File" menu.
2. Click on "Open", and select the problematic file.
3. Click on the "Open" drop-down arrow and select the "Open and Repair" option.
4. Using the hints, repair the file.
- **Copy and paste the broken part**. You will need to create a new document for this.
- **Update the software**. Formatting issues may occur because you use an old version of MS Publisher. It may be helpful to update to the latest version.
- **Seek professional help**. If none of these solutions work, ask [*technical support*](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/support) for help.


## Compatibility Issues ## 

`.pub` files sometimes have compatibility issues. They may happen when files are opened on different versions of Microsoft Publisher or other software. If you have them, here are some suggestions to try:
- **Save the file in a compatible format**. This will help prevent such problems, especially if you save the file in a format supported by most devices. For this click on the "File" menu, select "Save As", and choose a desirable format.
- **Convert the file to a different format**. This is an option if you cannot open the PUB file in any program or do not have MS Publisher on your device. If you do have the program, then the conversion can be done using the "Export" option of the "File" menu.
- **Update the software**. - This also may be helpful to solve the problems of compatibility. 
- **Use a compatibility pack**. - If you are trying to open a PUB file in another program such as Microsoft Word, you might use a compatibility pack that allows you to open and edit PUB files in other MS Office programs. You can download one from the [*Microsoft official website*](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/products-apps-services).
- **Seek professional help**. Again, if none of these solutions work, ask [*technical support*](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/support) for help.


## Printing Problems ## 

Users may encounter printing issues when working with .pub files. It can be poor print quality or wrong page orientation. Let's try to solve some of them.

| **Issue** | **Description(Example)** | **Suggested solution** |
| :- | :- | :- |
| Incorrect formatting| The issue may happen with any file format. If, for example, the margins or page size are set incorrectly, the content of the page may not fit on it or shift from the expected position when printing. | Ensure that the paper size and orientation settings are correct. Open the file in Microsoft Publisher and check for any formatting or layout issues. Fix them if there are any. |
| Corrupted file | The issue may happen due to a number of reasons, such as a software error or file damage during transmission. The pages could miss parts of the content, or even empty pages can be printed | Try to open the file on another device, to see if the problem is linked to the software or not. If not, use one of the suggestions from the next paragraph. |
| Missing fonts | If the .pub file uses fonts that are not available on the printer, the document may not print correctly with the text appearing differently or not at all. | Add or replace the missing fonts as it was described in the previous chapter. |
| Printer driver issues | If the printer driver is outdated or does not support the .pub file format, you may not be able to print out your documents. | Make sure that your printer is set up correctly and that it is selected as the default printer. Visit the manufacturer's website and download the latest drivers for your printer. |
| Low ink or toner | This is not actually a problem with the PUB format but is also worth mentioning here. When the printer is running low on ink or toner, the printing result may be faded or incomplete. | You need to charge the cartridge with the ink. |
| Printer hardware issues | Again, this is not actually a problem with the PUB format. If the printer itself is malfunctioning, it may not be able to print the .pub file or any other file correctly. | Take your printer to the service office. |

If the issue is not linked to the printer itself but to the format, you may also consider converting pub files to another format with better printing support, like XPS or PDF.

## Corrupt PUB Files ## 

If you found out that your .pub file is broken you may try the next suggestions to fix it(but first make sure the issue did not appear due to the software malfunctioning):
- **Open the file in Safe Mode.** - It will disable some features that may be the root of the problem, such as add-ins, custom toolbars, and some settings. To open a Publisher (PUB) file in safe mode, follow these steps:
1. Press and hold the Ctrl key.
2. Make double-click on the desired file. 
3. When the file opens in safe mode, you will see a message at the top of the window that says "Publisher has detected a problem with this file. Opening the file in safe mode will help you correct or eliminate the problem."
4. Click "OK" to continue.
5. Now you can edit and change your file as you wish.
- **Use the AutoRecover feature.** The program has an AutoRecover feature that automatically saves a copy of your file every few minutes. You can use this feature to recover the file. To do so, follow the next order:
1. Click on the "File" tab and select "Info".
2. Click on "Manage Document" and select "Recover Unsaved Documents".
3. Browse to the location where your file was located.
4. Pick up the file you want to recover and click "Open".
5. If it can be recovered Publisher will open it in a new window.
6. Now you can save the document to your desired location.
- **Check for backup copies.** If you have enabled the backup feature in Publisher, you may have a backup copy of the file. For this take the steps described in the previous paragraph. Do not forget to save your file regularly when working with it so you do have backup copies to use.

If none of these solutions work, you may have to recreate the file from scratch. Now you know that it is a good idea to regularly back up your files to avoid losing important data.

## Conclusion  ## 

When working with any file format you may face different problems. For MS Publisher files they are: missing fonts, images, or other content, errors with formatting, issues with compatibility, corrupted files, and problems with printing. Every of these issues have ways to resolve them but sometimes the only option left is to convert the file or to create it from scratch.
