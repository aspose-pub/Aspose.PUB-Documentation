This is useful information that is stored along with the document. Aspose.PUB for .NET lets you edit metadata of a PUB file using the [DocSummaryInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/net/pub/aspose.pub/docsummaryinfo) and [SummaryInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/net/pub/aspose.pub/summaryinfo) classes as shown in the following code sample.
