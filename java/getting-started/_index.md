Aspose.PUB for Java is a library designed for developers to read MS Publisher files `.pub`, read their metadata and convert such files to PDF format in just a few lines of Java code. With this API, developers can work with PUB files without the need to understand the file format structure. This allows Java application developers to create conversion applications for the transformation of PUB files to PDF format easily.
